Description: ixlib is a small c++ tools library based upon the standard template library.
  It provides a javascript interperter, an exception handling framework,
  garbage collection, automatic array management, planar geometry (rectangles, regions),
  polygons (rasterization, convex hull, smoothing, removal of crossings),
  rasterization primitives, matrices (including linear system solver, Cholesky 
  and LU decomposition, determinants, inversion, Gauss and Gauss-Jordan elimination),
  command line parsing, versatile int <-> string conversions, regular expressions and
  xml parsing (non-DTD) 
Keywords: ixlib, c++, library, tools, stl, javascript, exception, garbage collection, gc,
  geometry, polygon, rasterization, matrix, cholesky, determinant, lu, gauss, gauss-jordan,
  regular expression, regex, xml

Platforms: Linux and Win32 (w/mingw) tested, other platforms might work.
  ixlib needs a strict-ANSI C++ compiler with SGI STL hash_map libraries.
  gcc 2.95.2 and gcc 3.0 are known to work, others might, too.
