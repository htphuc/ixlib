    Welcome to ixlib.<p>
    
    ixlib is a small c++ tools library based upon the standard template library.
    It provides <p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> a javascript interpreter
      <li> an exception handling framework
      <li> garbage collection
      <li> automatic array management
      <li> planar geometry (rectangles, regions)
      <li> polygons (rasterization, convex hull, smoothing, removal of crossings) 
      <li> rasterization primitives
      <li> matrices (including linear system solver, Cholesky and LU decomposition,
        determinants, inversion, Gauss and Gauss-Jordan elimination)
      <li> command line parsing
      <li> versatile int <-> string conversions
      <li> regular expressions
      <li> xml parsing (non-DTD)
      </ul>
    
    Of course, you won't download anything before looking at a
    screenshot, so here is <a href="shot.png">yours</a>.
    ixlib also has some documentation available. As of
    0.95.0, it is available in tarball form, further
    it may be browsed on-line <a href="doc/index.html">here</a>.<p>
    
    It mixes well with STL code and has templates where they make sense. 
    All components are independent of each other.
    Furthermore, every component of ixlib has been thoroughly tested
    and is considered production-quality code. Installation and use is
    drop-dead easy because of supplied autoconf macros and an 
    <code>ixlib-config</code> shell script.
    
    ixlib currently depends on
    <ul>
      <li> a good c++ compiler (gcc 2.95 will do)
      <li> the SGI STL (i.e. an STL implementation containing a "hash_map")
        (normally included with your c++ compiler, e.g. gcc)
      <li> flex
      </ul>
